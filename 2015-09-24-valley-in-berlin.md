- co-founded Book a Tiger - similar model as Homejoy
- also co-founded Delivery Hero
- active angel investor

### The business idea

- the idea does not matter
- but you should at least have an idea you feel good about
- proof? myspace vs facebook (Facebook: recycled idea, amazing success)

#### Market

- choosing the right market is important
- mediocre teams can also be successful by picking right market
- combine killer team with great market

### Building great teams

- hiring is most crucial task
- don't just hire to fill a position
- new hires for key positions need to be interviewed by founders
- when in doubt, personal/company fit over skills/experience
- beware of hiring explosions that concur with growth explosions - they can lead to B players on your team

#### Tips

- hiring cheap/junior engineers doesn't pay off
- put applicants in real situations in interviews
- be honest about growth of the company
- if you do this right, you get to go on vacation
- onboarding asap
- frequent and upfront feedback
- test the hire's abilities and company fit quickly

### Avoiding the waterfall

- don't make a Gantt chart yo
- you don't know what you should build
- dependencies / critical paths kill startups
- everything changes with the first customer
- iterate iterate iterate
- test your idea quickly
  - launch with a version you're embarassed about
  - don't try to perfect the first version
- but...
  - have a vision
  - plan but be ready to adapt
  - create an environment of change

### Making educated decisions

- super revenue growth doesn't always mean sustainability
- you need to understand your how your business works
- track everything with real data
- build systems that explain the truth of the business (main KPIs)
- Business Intelligence is important
  - understanding your companies data and turning it into decisions

- Ben involved with Founder Institute

### What is a bubble?

- same thing that happened in first dot com bubble
- investment happy now, but it could be unsustainable market speculation
- companies being valued really high but us not knowing if they are viable

### Are we in a bubble or not?

- industry is really divided
- avg one new article a week
- first bubble happened because people wanted to get on to the revolutionary internet train
  - could see a huge difference between NASDAQ and S&P
- this huge difference is not present now
  - but, does this actually mean anything?
- Sam Altman, a16z bullish (they think no bubble)
- Fred Wilson: this is arrogance and pride on the side of the startups (he thinks bubble)
  - this is probably a bit valid

### What makes up a bubble

- Hyman Minsky wrote about key factors
  - Diplacement
  - Boom
  - Euphoria
  - Profit Taking.. ? Where does this come in?

### Does this all matter?

- predicting downturns in US economy like predicting an earthquake (impossible to know when and how hard it's going to hit)
- Sequoia sent out slide deck with hard rules after bubble burst
  - spending
  - growth assumptions
  - earnings assumptions
  - must-have product
  - but, these are all normal business things
- Warren Buffet: "You only find out who's swimming naked when the tide goes out."
  - the tide always goes out
- Fred Wilson: "At some point you have to build a real business, generate real profits, sustain the company without ... investor's capital..."

### How to build a real business?

- Real profits
  - revenue model
- sustainable growth
  - growth based on real projections
