### The business idea

- the idea does not matter
- but you should at least have an idea you feel good about
- proof? myspace vs facebook (Facebook: recycled idea, amazing success)

#### Market

- choosing the right market is important
- mediocre teams can also be successful by picking right market
- combine killer team with great market

### Building great teams

- hiring is most crucial task
- don't just hire to fill a position
- new hires for key positions need to be interviewed by founders
- when in doubt, personal/company fit over skills/experience
- beware of hiring explosions that concur with growth explosions - they can lead to B players on your team

#### Tips

- hiring cheap/junior engineers doesn't pay off
- put applicants in real situations in interviews
- be honest about growth of the company
- if you do this right, you get to go on vacation
- onboarding asap
- frequent and upfront feedback
- test the hire's abilities and company fit quickly

### Avoiding the waterfall

- don't make a Gantt chart yo
- you don't know what you should build
- dependencies / critical paths kill startups
- everything changes with the first customer
- iterate iterate iterate
- test your idea quickly
  - launch with a version you're embarassed about
  - don't try to perfect the first version
- but...
  - have a vision
  - plan but be ready to adapt
  - create an environment of change

### Making educated decisions

- super revenue growth doesn't always mean sustainability
- you need to understand your how your business works
- track everything with real data
- build systems that explain the truth of the business (main KPIs)
- Business Intelligence is important
  - understanding your companies data and turning it into decisions
