### The business idea

- the idea does not matter
- but you should at least have an idea you feel good about
- proof? myspace vs facebook (Facebook: recycled idea, amazing success)

#### Market

- choosing the right market is important
- mediocre teams can also be successful by picking right market
- combine killer team with great market

### Building great teams

- hiring is most crucial task
- don't just hire to fill a position
- new hires for key positions need to be interviewed by founders
- when in doubt, personal/company fit over skills/experience

### Avoiding the waterfall
### Making educated decisions
