- Jenn currently works for EventBrite
- creator of Human Wasteland and Developers Developers
- sometimes in conversations with other developers, it's hard to understand
  - so many different names for things and easy to confuse them (it's one of the hard things in computer science)

### Parameter vs Argument

- parameters help define a function (at function definition), arguments are passed into a function (at function call)

### Scope

- scope on wikipedia: the scope of a name binding – an association of a name to an entity, such as a variable – is the part of a computer program where the binding is valid: where the name can be used to refer to the entity
- lexical scoping: the portion of the source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies. Virtually unchanged since ALGOL 1960.

#### Lexical vs Dynamic

- for most programming languages, "part of a program" refers to "portion of the source code (area of text)", and is known as lexical scope
- in some languages "part of a program" refers to "portion of run time (time period during execution)", and is known as dynamic scope

### Recursion

- most common definition in math or computer science
- simple definition: a function that calls itself

### Concatenation

- etymology dictionary: to link together in a chain

### Instantiate

- to represent as or by an instance
- in philosophy: Universal Instantiation: a valid rule of inference from a truth about each member of a class of individuals to the truth about a particular individual of that class

### Acronyms

- CRM: customer relationship manager
- CMS: content management system
- CDN: content delivery network
- Saas: software as a service
- Sass: syntactically awesome stylesheets
- DOM: document object module. Structured tree representation of a document
- CLI: command line interface
- GUI: graphical user interface. introduced in reaction to steep learning curve of CLIs
- AJAX: asynchronous javascript and xml. Outdated - most APIs use JSON

### What to do

- help each other out

## How the browser actually renders a website

- Ryan works at Zendesk
- 30,000 ft view

### High level view

- browser one of the most complex applications ever
  - bindings (talking to network, etc)
  - rendering: (parsing, layout, painting)
  - platform (windows, osx, linux specific stuff)
  - JavaScript VM
- we're covering the rendering part
- flow: parse html + parse css => render tree => layout => paint

### In-depth view

#### parsing html

- HTML is forgiving by nature
  - xhtml strict wasn't
- parsing isn't straightforward
- can be halted
- will do speculative parsing
  - will look ahead for images, scripts, css to fetch
- it's reentrant
- script link and style tags will halt parser as script can alter the document
  - network latency
  - this is why you add scripts at the bottom of the document (faster to render, parsing uninterrupted)
    - can alternately do this with defer or async attributes

#### DOM and CSSOM

- not a 1 to 1 mapping of your html (multiple trees)
  - RenderObjects
    - visual output
    - geometric info
    - can layout and paint
    - style and computed metrics
  - RenderStyles
  - RenderLayers
    - creates layers from RenderObjects
    - positions nodes, transparency, overflow, canvas, video
  - line boxes - will change if element needs to reflow to next line
- not in render tree: hidden nodes

#### Layout

- recursive process
  - traverses render tree
  - positions and sizes nodes
  - layouts its children
- will batch layouts
  - intelligent change batching
  - render tree items will flag selves as dirty and these will be collected later to be processed
  - async
- certain things will cause immediate layout
  - font sizing
  - accessing props like width and height

### Performance insights

- take notes from browser
  - bad: read then write, read then write
  - good: read, read, write
  - real world: FastDom: preventing layout thrashing
  - most modern JS frameworks do this internally
- painting: bitmap uploaded to GPU and composited
- inline critical CSS: speeds up first paint times
  - browser can make a delta from last bitmap

## What I learned teaching programming to 150 beginners

by [Etiene da Cruz Dalcol](https://twitter.com/etiene_d)

- did [a workshop](https://github.com/Etiene/jsduckhunt) for JavaScript for 150 people for 2 hours
  - variables
  - arrays
  - loops
  - fuctions
  - operators
  - conditions

### Beginners

- for beginners it's really tough when code doesn't work due to small mistakes like indentation or missed brackets or something
- JS - we can use a subset of the language to make things easier for the beginners
- Lua a bit obscure
- Tooling for JS good as well
  - Mozilla Thimble
- 0 effort
- no additional libraries
- easy to visualize
- easy to remember

### Teaching Tips

- have everything ready
- skeleton code is very useful
- use an easy url
- set a time limit and then give out the answers
- cover the main lessons first, and leave the extras for the end
- typography: be careful that the characters in the typography are easily recognizable
- inspiring your students is important
  - show examples of things they can build
  - showing people having fun with things they built
- reserve some time in your work to teach others
