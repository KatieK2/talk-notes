- sometimes in conversations with other developers, it's hard to understand
  - so many different names for things and easy to confuse them (it's one of the hard things in computer science)

### Parameter vs Argument

- parameters help define a function (at function definition), arguments are passed into a function (at function call)

### Scope

- scope on wikipedia: the scope of a name binding – an association of a name to an entity, such as a variable – is the part of a computer program where the binding is valid: where the name can be used to refer to the entity
- lexical scoping: the portion of the source code in which a binding of a name with an entity applies. Virtually unchanged since ALGOL 1960.

#### Lexical vs Dynamic

- for most programming languages, "part of a program" refers to "portion of the source code (area of text)", and is known as lexical scope
- in some languages "part of a program" refers to "portion of run time (time period during execution)", and is known as dynamic scope

### Recursion

- most common definition in math or computer science
- simple definition: a function that calls itself

### Concatenation

- etymology dictionary: to link together in a chain

### Instantiate

- to represent as or by an instance
- in philosophy: Universal Instantiation: a valid rule of inference from a truth about each member of a class of individuals to the truth about a particular individual of that class

### Acronyms

- CRM: customer relationship manager
- CMS: content management system
- CDN: content delivery network
- Saas: software as a service
- Sass: syntactically awesome stylesheets
- DOM: document object module. Structured tree representation of a document
- CLI: command line interface
- GUI: graphical user interface. introduced in reaction to steep learning curve of CLIs
- AJAX: asynchronous javascript and xml. Outdated - most APIs use JSON

### What to do

- help each other out
