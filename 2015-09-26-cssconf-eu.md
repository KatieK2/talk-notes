## The Front-End Revolution

by [Claudina Sarahe](https://twitter.com/itsmisscs)

- what is revolutionary? something that disrupts normal dynamics and changes everything around it
- as our devices have taken over and more of the world comes online, we need more people involved in the community
- many new tools
- transforming our lives as developers
- they can turn our capabilities into opportunities
- revolutions don't happen when we adopt new technologies
- they happen when we adopt new behaviors

### Fogg Behavior Method

- method for developing persuasive technologies
- computers may be actually able to modify and change what people do

#### What causes behavior

- motivation
  - money
  - freedom
- ability
  - time
  - skills
- trigger
  - ex. an article that you read that inspires you to do something
  - requirements:
    - we have to notice them
    - we have to associate this trigger with a target behavior

### Tooling history

- new JS frameworks in 2000s started a revolution in web dev
  - trying to make the APIs of the web simpler
- jQuery (2006) succeeded because of
  - simplicity
  - good documentation
  - invitation to contribute
- jQuery's first plugin very early on
- CSS was having its renaissance at this time
  - 960px grid frameworks
  - IE 6-9
  - CSS3 was coming with many new features
  - SMACSS, OOCSS, BEM were developed
  - Sass, Less, etc with CSS preprocessors
- Sass
  - won 2014 .Net game changer award
  - one article: 66% of devs in one study using Sass
  - now influencing CSS
    - variables (custom properties)
    - mixins
    - grids
    - blend modes
- our tools are opening up new opportunities for us
- there are no longer these large institutions holding up progress in the space
- collective participation + collective action = required ingredients for change

### Small world networks

- small world networks: many nodes that are connected together
- resistent to damage
- disseminate information very well
- our frontend networks enjoy this resilience
- this will only come through participation
- maybe we can use these same techniques and connections to change things in other networks like our cities

- "changes of scale mean that improbable theories become likely and that unlikely events become certainties"
