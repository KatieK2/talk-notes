Lessons from a Low-Flying Industry
==================================

by [Chris Studabaker](https://twitter.com/cstudabaker)

* email design started: Hotmail 1996 (free, low requirements, anyone could get an address)
* email -> permissive (people sign up and permit communication with them)
* email design is often compared to web design, but email has key differences
  * short dev cycle
  * not periodically delivered
  * customers not asking a website to reach out to them
  * supporting other marketing channels
* email is periodical: through multiple emails you’re developing a relationship with the customer
  * each email is a small part of the larger
* very little oversight over email design
  * “mad scientist” syndrome: trying out many different techniques, take chances
* story arcs are important
  * if your story arcs are short, like a rising and falling action every episode, your viewers will become fatigued. longer story arcs are more fulfilling
* 4 key lessons
  * *aggressive learners win:* making a point to absorb a huge amount of information and tying it together very well
  * *data inspires design creativity:* how can we use analytics to improve our design exploration
  * *design drives business (which drives design):* design of your emails leads to success or failures, which affects business. You can allow the business data to shape your design process and get better results.
  * *design is constraint:* it's about being given a problem and needing to find a solution. wacky constraints cause us to take a different path than web development.
