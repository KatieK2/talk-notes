Lessons from a Low-Flying Industry
==================================

by [Chris Studabaker](https://twitter.com/cstudabaker)

* email design started: Hotmail 1996 (free, low requirements, anyone could get an address)
* email -> permissive (people sign up and permit communication with them)
* email design is often compared to web design, but email has key differences
  * short dev cycle
  * not periodically delivered
  * customers not asking a website to reach out to them
  * supporting other marketing channels
* email is periodical: through multiple emails you’re developing a relationship with the customer
  * each email is a small part of the larger
* very little oversight over email design
  * “mad scientist” syndrome: trying out many different techniques, take chances
* story arcs are important
  * if your story arcs are short, like a rising and falling action every episode, your viewers will become fatigued. longer story arcs are more fulfilling
* 4 key lessons
  * *aggressive learners win:* making a point to absorb a huge amount of information and tying it together very well
  * *data inspires design creativity:* how can we use analytics to improve our design exploration
  * *design drives business (which drives design):* design of your emails leads to success or failures, which affects business. You can allow the business data to shape your design process and get better results.
  * *design is constraint:* it's about being given a problem and needing to find a solution. wacky constraints cause us to take a different path than web development.

Test Your Way To Success
========================

by [Tim Watson](https://twitter.com/tawatson)

* even comedian do test runs of their content
* split customers 50/50, find out which performs better
* we have theories, but we should test to be sure
* test things that are going to allow you to reuse the knowledge
* hypotheses (customer stories): what is the customer thinking?
  * ex. "header is too busy", "two calls to action are too confusing"
* open, click and convert rates
  * design changes can more wildly influence convert and click rates
  * careful consideration needs to be made to get a balance of the best results
* most tests won't win you anything
* incremental and compounding gains
* obama campaign:
  * $500M from email, +$200M from email testing
  * sometimes extreme simplicity wins
  * "frankenstein" emails: emails created from winning parts of other emails
* validity of your tests (repeatability, reliability)
  * test cell sizes - min 3k, better 5k - 10k, sometimes 25k+
* rarity of response
  * conversion rate change is difficult to measure since it doesn't happen very often
* small changes -> small results
* big changes -> big results
* wait periods
  * 10 days for $$
  * 2 or 3 days for click results
* don't be afraid of doing large changes in your tests - easier to learn a lot more quickly

Data For Designers
==================

by [Kristina Huffman](https://twitter.com/krudz)
and Schuyler Wareham

* it's called art **work** for a reason, not art **fuckingaround**
* benchmarks are bullshit - measure for yourself
* don't get stuck in the world where specific devices matter
* mobile triage is a myth
* peak times morning, evening for mobile
* less clicks on mobile
  * more opens, less clicks
  * factors: usability, trust, time
  * mobile clicks won't ever catch up to desktop
* but multi-platform openers are high clickers
* 60% mobile only, 20% mobile+desktop, 20% desktop only
* click overlay heat maps are a great tool to see if there are big deficits in your design
* data-driven decisions vs expertise driven decisions (design whims)
* large dormant percentage of audience masks true impact of improvements
* purest way to test is with new subscribers
* "more white space" - every designer
  * for better results: use data points like increasing readability to justify design decisions
