Lessons from a Low-Flying Industry
==================================

* email design started: Hotmail 1996 (free, low requirements, anyone could get an address)
* email -> permissive (people sign up and permit communication with them)
* email design is often compared to web design, but email has key differences
  * short dev cycle
  * not periodically delivered
  * customers not asking a website to reach out to them
  * supporting other marketing channels
* email is periodical: through multiple emails you’re developing a relationship with the customer
  * each email is a small part of the larger
* very little oversight over email design
  * “mad scientist” syndrome: trying out many different techniques, take chances
