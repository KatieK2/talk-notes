-----------------------------------------

by [Floor Drees](https://twitter.com/floordrees)

* we will be really talking about readme-driven development
* but - a readme doesn't replace documentation
* Floor
  * was in berlin, moved back for sektor 5
  * core member of railsgirls summer of code
  * working as a technical documentation writer
* often, we start writing docs when they're done
  * we should start writing requirements before the coding starts
  * avoid feature creep
  * readme-driven development (RDD) brings back an element of product design

### Readme-driven Development

* helps with BDD - behavior- or business-driven development
* helps detect unnecessary complexity early on
* write issues like your documentation
* by being very detailed, this helps other developers work with your product early
* helps to gather feedback early on
* highly visible on GitHub, etc
* easy to provide guidelines collaboration
* pro tip: include in code reviews

### What's a good readme
* write honest, realistic readmes
  * include features that actually already exist
  * air your dirty laundry in your readme
* include lots of code samples
* contributers
* communities available
* license details
* badges for build status
