how color works on the screen
-----------------------------

* white pixels made up of 3 subpixels (rgb)
  * can have different order
  * different subpixel intensities for different colors

rgb
---

* can be thought of as a coordinate system
  * can be mapped to a cube
  * most color pickers flatten one of the dimensions and then allow you to tweak the other two
* in css, we can set colors with the rgba() notation or #xxxxxx / #xxx hex notation
  * both forms are confusing
* another option: css color names
  * very ugly colors
  * some newer: super long, racist, or completely crazy (dark gray )
* currentColor in css3
* fun rgb / hsl guessing game: [http://leaverou.github.io/whatthecolor](http://leaverou.github.io/whatthecolor)

hsl
---

* different coord system: can be mapped to a cone
* lightness in hsl is not perceptual lightness for us as humans, because it's just a transformation of rgb
  * lightness is not the same as luminance

enter: relative luminance
-------------------------

* from wcag 2.0, css4
* to achieve perceptual lightness, blue is multiplied by smaller number as green as red

alpha blending
--------------

* compositing two colors and alpha strengths to calculate what the opaque color should be

css4
----

* gray(xx%) - unsupported now, but can be polyfilled with sass
* adjustors: tint, shade, blend


[AngularJS and i18n](http://pascalprecht.github.io/slides/angularjs-and-i18n/#/)
===================

* professional animated gif executer

angularjs
---------

* design as if html had been designed for apps (html++ so to say)
* two way data binding
  * one single source of truth (within scopes)
  * declarative views, don't need to write traditional javascript code
* directives to define functionality on elements
* web components to define your own elements
* routes
* built with testability in mind

internationalization / localization
-----------------------------------

* abstracting your strings for use in different languages, countries
* angular support
  * datetime, number, currency, ngPluralize
  * $locale service (from ngLocale)
  * unfortunately, that's it - can't translate all strings

introducing angular-translate
-----------------------------

* typical components: services, filters, directives
* var replacement
* multi-language
* fallback languages
* missing tranlsation support
* async
* localStorage to save locale
* changing the language at runtime with simple controller method

How to Get More Women in Tech in 5 Steps
========================================

by [Anika Lindtner](https://twitter.com/langziehohr)

* Travis CI supporter of Railsgirls from the start
* very low population of women in
* traditional answers
  * "they're just not so good at it"
  * "they're just not interested"
  * we know that these are not true
* stereotypes are much different today than earlier
* there are no gender-specific abilities
* missing role models
* fear of change

Where can we start?
-------------------

* daily life - talking, why you love what you do
* support and inspire others
* family - raise children to follow their dreams, regardless of gender
* workshops - get people together to get excited about code

Railsgirls summer of code 2013
------------------------------

* workshop
* 3-months, full-time, paid
* raised $80k, were able to support 19 student
* more joined after as well, total 33 students

Which 5 steps?
--------------

* there are no five steps, takes hundreds of small actions to change the culture

[Fly, You Tools!](http://talks.chastell.net)
============================================

by [Piotr Szotkowski](https://twitter.com/chastell)

* typical bug hunting: just like lord of the rings
* piotr working at the warsaw university of tech
* you know there are some nifty things
* you read a lot of blog posts
* you can never remember the tricks

git
---

* git is like a sharp knife, with the handle also a knife, and then fractals into more knives
* ```git rebase --interactive --autosquash``` - holy shit, don't need to do anymore work
* ```--allow-empty``` for first git init commit
* ```git log --oneline --decorate``` for one-line log
* ```git diff --ignore-all-space``` or ```git diff -w``` diffs without whitespace - can be activated as ?w=1 to end of github diff urls

postgres
--------

* wow, all the datatypes! if it were only named better
* curved and square brackets for inclusive and exclusive ranges
* hstore
* JSON

cli
---

### piping ###
* grepping / sorting / uniqing git commit messages for commit statistics
* cutting / xarging / tring / bc to get total migration time
* pipe viewer - show you the progress of something the command line

### interesting commands ###
* ```pgrep``` and ```pkill``` find and kill processes by name instead of id
* ```watch``` - rerun every x seconds
* ```timeout``` kill a process after x time
* ```proxylocal``` expose local port to public

### in bash.profile ###
* ```alias computer,='sudo'``` - ```computer, apt-get install postgresql```


Make Your and Other Peopleâ€™s Life Easier: Do Support!
=====================================================

by [Mike Adolphs](https://twitter.com/fooforge)

* github is
  * code hosting
  * enterprise
  * git training worldwide
  * youtube channel
  * conferences
  * vision: "easier to work together as to work alone"

History of support
------------------
* first version of support: your handbag broke, fix it!
* 1876: telephone
* advent of telephone: remote support
* 20th century: call centers, cramming people into cubicles
* since call centers, support has a bad rep for entry-level employees
* but support is more like firefighting, enabling user to get back to work

Support at github
-----------------

* people in 26 timezones all over the world providing support
* tech support for native clients
* account support
* enterprise team -> just enterprise only
* github trying to merge the two support teams into single team
* support never stops, but support team deserves to take part in company cultural activities too

### Rules ###
* never get into a fight with the customer
* don't insult the customer
* don't endlessly apologize as an excuse
* don't pretend to have superpowers - no single human can know everything
* don't advertise to users without them asking
* don't let yourself get dragged down

### Superfans ###
* when you do following, you gain superfans:
  * support done right and quickly
  * repo corruption quickly cleaned up

Why help out?
-------------

* stable software
* just one dish in the sink at a time - focus on one thing at a time
* who are you really working for? the whole userbase, not upper management
* learning
* empathy - learn how to put yourself in the user's shoes
  * turned Mike into a socializing human being from an angry sysadmin

Vagrant, Packer, Serf: Maximum Potency DevOps
=============================================

by [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://twitter.com/mitchellh)

* devops used to be easier: just start with chef or puppet
* now a lot more confusing: much more saturated terain
* HashiCorp
  * try to build tools to solve pain points for companies
  * tools: Vagrant, Packer, SERF

application lifecycle
---------------------
=== 1) development ===
* your work should be able to be easily accessible anywhere
* make changes, see changes (golden circle of code, save, reload)
* "it works on my machine"
* collaboration
=== 2) deployment ===
* deployment
  * complex, multiple steps
  * no companies happy with the
=== 3) maintenance ===
* monitoring
* updating
* orchestrating (managing load balancing, scaling)


* pragmatic goal of devops: making the lifecycle easier

how do we make the lifecycle easier? tools
------------------------------------------
* devops tools will make one or more of the three application lifestyle steps easier
* heroku deals with deployment and maintenance
* when you build a tool, you remove the need for users to know how it works
* increase repeatability
* codification of knowledge

Vagrant
-------
* helps with dev part of lifecycle
* anyone in your company can clone out a project (whatever language it is), and have all of the tools they need to work
* virtualbox
* vagrant separates host and guest machines
  * creates a sync between the two machines
  * technology agnostic
* still able to code local on your machine
* consistency: works on linux, osx, windows
* new features
  * ```vagrant share``` makes a public url for your machine
  * ```vagrant connect``` ssh to a remote vagrant machine

Packer
------
* helps with deployment part of the lifecycle (no orchestration)
* other stuff already in the space: chef, docker, capistrano, puppet
* optimize the slow parts of the server by building a server
* devops has been historically against images
  * why?
    * 10 years ago, images were the only way servers were deployed
    * devops people were in a dark corner of the office, alone deploying the images
    * slow iteration
* unfortunately we threw away a lot of the improvements
  * super-fast deployment
  * ops without machine images is like normal applications without binaries (building from source code)
  * if one of the dependencies changes, the deploy without machine images can fail

SERF
----
* helps with maintenance
