JSON Hypertext Application Language and JSON Schema Validation
==============================================================

by [Lars d](http://www.meetup.com/viennajs/members/42307112/)

* Das Curry-Buch Review
  * zuviel Geschwurbel
  * zu wenig neues
  * kann Beititel nicht erfüllen
  * schlechte Beispiele
  * gut: Kapitel über Events/CPS
  * anstatt: Higher-Order JavaScript
* SpiderMonkey
  * new JIT engine OdinMonkey - lots with ASM.js
* better json validation with schemas
  * most favoured schema: json schema
* server-side validation
  * clear error messaging
* HAL
  * hyperlinks in JSON to maintain RESTfulness

    * window.navigator.standalone
    * meta tags
  * 300ms click delay - [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) by FT Labs
  * browser-style inputs
    * mobiscroll - custom ui elements
  * "native"-feel scrolling in ios - iScroll
  * performance - WebWorkers (Parallel.js)
    * offload heavy operations to prevent ui blocking
  * error tracking / logging
    * Qbaka, ErrorCeption
      * great, but not so focused on offline / mobile usage
    * js-logger better
  * online / offline state - html5 app cache
    * simple update mechanism
    * SalesChamp updates devices by notifying them when new version is available
  * online / offline state - window.navigator.isOnline
    * buggy, different implementations in browsers - workaround: ajax / settimeout
  * online / offline state - socket.io
  * databases
    * websql
    * indexeddb
    * pouchdb
* with all the possibilities that html5 and javascript bring, you can build a modern app

  * is not Node
  * JavaScript on the JVM
  * multithreaded

  * multithreaded instead of continuous event loop
* growing ecosystem
* new website, more docs
* at orf.at - backend of fm4 on demand
* backend of wahl 13 (election)

Substance in your apps
======================

by [Michael Aufreiter](https://twitter.com/_mql) and [Oliver Buchtala](https://github.com/oliver----)

* Substance
  * browser-based editing and viewing
  * open JSON-based document model
  * strict separation of content and layout
  * annotations
  * versioning
* science use case: eLife Lens - public open source project
* view text and references at the same time, interactively
* document outline
* issues, commenting
* Substance Surface
  * visual editing component
  * operates on data, not html
  * clean html
  * annotations
  * fosters mvc
  * fast - scales to large docs
* why Surface is better than contenteditable
  * mvc or custom model? have to build it yourself in contenteditable
  * browser-incompatibilities
* Surface suppresses DOM manip
  * complex: mapping nodes to DOM

things that are terribly wrong in the js world (controversial stuff)
====================================================================

by [Arpad Borsos](https://github.com/Swatinem)

* bad things
* grunt.js
  * reinventing the wheel
  * doing it completely wrong
  * lots of deps
  * need to write lots of json
* just use Make!
  * with projects with 10k+ files processed individually, yes
* requirejs
  * huge boilerplate, deps
  * alternatives: commonjs, https://github.com/component/component
* angularjs
  * very, very slow
  * undebuggable
  * unmaintanable
  * hard to reason about
  * horrible performance
  * feels like last-century annotated html
  * recommendation: write your own:
    * model binding
    * lightweight models
    * observer / emitter patterns
* frameworks in general
  * don't use frameworks, use libraries instead
* jquery
  * use standards
  * use small libraries for what you need
* challenge everything
* keep asking: "can you do any better?"
