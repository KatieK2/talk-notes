Polyglot programming in JS: how to build large frontend apps by thinking like a backend developer
=================================================================================================

* jealous of backend developers (they can use any language as opposed to the limited selection on the functional front-end)
* in rewriting Prezi in JS, they wanted to allow TypeScript or JavaScript
* type checking
* elm: functional language supported by Prezi

* scaffolding: yeoman backbone with require.js
* normally in a backbone.js + require.js application, request for every single file
* default yeoman build - large single main.js request
* route-based modules: small per-view downloads
* yeoman has long-standing issue for integrating r.js
  * this would need a lot of work - deeply integrated
* require.js config
  * main module for shared stuff
  * sub-modules: exclude shared stuff, include dependencies
