Polyglot programming in JS: how to build large frontend apps by thinking like a backend developer
=================================================================================================

by [Laszlo Pandy](http://laszlopandy.com/)

* jealous of backend developers (they can use any language as opposed to the limited selection on the functional front-end)
* in rewriting Prezi in JS, they wanted to allow TypeScript or JavaScript
* type checking
* elm: functional language supported by Prezi

Optimizing Backbone Apps with r.js
==================================

by [Attila Kerekes](https://twitter.com/keriati)

* scaffolding: yeoman backbone with require.js
* normally in a backbone.js + require.js application, request for every single file
* default yeoman build - large single main.js request
* route-based modules: small per-view downloads
* yeoman has long-standing issue for integrating r.js
  * this would need a lot of work - deeply integrated
* require.js config
  * main module for shared stuff
  * sub-modules: exclude shared stuff, include dependencies

* when you have a module, you have a test that goes along with it, along with mocks for dependencies
* unit spec (tested by unit tests) aligns with product spec (tested by acceptance tests)
* shouldn't work using a spec, should be a conversation
* BDD: behaviour-driven development
  * how you think it should work
  * code reviews: starting a conversation
* the runner
  * can run your tests without mocks
  * a case, a suite, or a whole spec
* tests are done with a docker container with chrome and vnc for the visual comparisons

* framing itself as a fast way to develop web apps, whether experienced or just getting started. but does it live up to it?
* open source
  * strong core team
  * 11k github followers
* platform
  * full-stack
  * built on node.js - can use any node.js packages
  * eco packages
  * js, coffeescript, etc
  * realtime - synchronicity handled by the framework (ddp protocol)
* fast dev
  * 1-min install
  * dev server with live reload
  * less boilerplate

========

* web should be a first-class mobile platform just like the others
* ionic - wrapper around angular with phonegap
* it often works too!
